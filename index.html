Opioids can also be misused, like taking a higher dosage of a painkiller than what a doctor prescribed. Other types of misuse can be unlawful, including taking heroin — which is illegal in all instances — or taking Oxycodone that has been legally prescribed to another person. This latter behavior, transferring drugs prescribed for one person to be used by someone else, is known as “diversion”.</dd>

                                        Short-term side-effects include drowsiness, depressed breathing, and euphoria. Long-term usage can trigger the body to develop tolerance, dependence, and addiction.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Tolerance is the body’s natural response to the regular presence of a substance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect.</li>
                                            <li>Dependence occurs when the body becomes so accustomed to the presence of a substance that its sudden absence causes withdrawal. For an opioid user, that could also mean that a prescription to address localized pain (a shoulder, a knee, a back) could cause pain all over the body if the prescription ends without tapering off.</li>
                                            <li>Addiction is a complex brain-body disease, where brain and body responses have changed to negatively and drastically affect behavior. This often includes an irresistible compulsion for short-term relief even in the face of both immediate and long-term risk.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Each side-effect is independent of the others, meaning that any, all, or none may occur in any individual.

                                        <h4>What are the side-effects of using opioids?</h4>
                                        <p>Short-term side-effects include drowsiness, depressed breathing, and euphoria. Long-term usage can trigger the body to develop tolerance, dependence, and addiction.</p>
                                        <ul class="neg-space-col">
                                            <li><strong>Tolerance</strong> is the body’s natural response to the regular presence of a substance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Dependence</strong> occurs when the body becomes so accustomed to the presence of a substance that its sudden absence causes withdrawal. For an opioid user, that could also mean that a prescription to address localized pain (a shoulder, a knee, a back) could cause pain all over the body if the prescription ends without tapering off.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Addiction</strong> is a complex brain-body disease, where brain and body responses have changed to negatively and drastically affect behavior. This often includes an irresistible compulsion for short-term relief even in the face of both immediate and long-term risk.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Each side-effect is independent of the others, meaning that any, all, or none may occur in any individual.</p>

                            <p>Economically, addiction is more costly than other brain conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke.

                            <p>However, economic impacts are hardly the most negative aspects of addiction and, more specifically, the opioid epidemic. Addiction to opioids can put people at greater risk for infectious diseases like HIV or hepatitis, deteriorating conditions like cirrhosis or cognitive decline, family disruption like domestic violence or child abuse, job loss, exposure to criminal behavior, overdose, and death.</p>

                            <p>Opioids are incredibly powerful drugs that have transformed the way the health care world treats and manages pain. However, because they are so potent, they can be dangerous if misused. To understand the opioid epidemic, it’s important to realize how both legal prescription medications and illegal substances impact the crisis in Massachusetts. To investigate the scope of the problem, we considered the entire population of all adults<a href="#footnote-1" class="page-scroll" onclick="BoldText(document.getElementById(&quot;footnote-1&quot;));"><sup>10</sup></a> as potential opioid users.</p>

                            <p>The number of opioids prescribed to residents of Massachusetts has increased roughly 7% annually since 2000. Between 2011 and 2014, 2 in 5 adults in the study had legal prescriptions for opioids, averaging more than 6 opioid prescriptions each. If spread out across the whole group, that’s roughly 2.5 opioid prescriptions per adult. During that period, about 8.8 million opioid prescriptions were filled in total.</p>

                            <p>Even when people use opioids for legitimate medical reasons, they can become dependent on or addicted to the drug. When this happens, the body’s craving for an opioid continues even if a prescription runs out. In these cases, many people continue to use opioids illegally. More than <a class="controls controls-svg" onclick="_gaq.push(['b._trackEvent', 'intext', 'clicked', 'rx-history-2thirds'])" data-select="2/3">two thirds</a> of people who died from an opioid overdose had a legal opioid prescription at some point.

                            <p>It should be noted that opioid-related deaths began increasing sharply in 2012, no similar increase in opioid prescriptions was recorded. This suggests that no single substance or health care practice is solely responsible for the current opioid crisis. Rather, it’s a complex issue with a number of contributing factors.</p>

                            <h2>Multiple Prescribers</h2>
                            <p>One risk factor for fatal overdose that was identified was the number of opioid prescribers for an individual. There are legitimate reasons why someone might have multiple prescribers — primary care plus specialists or multi-provider practices — but there is an elevated risk for this group. The fatal overdose rate for individuals with three or more prescribers is 7 times higher than the rate for other people.</p>
                            <h2>Multiple Substances</h2>
                            <p>Not only is having multiple prescribers a risk factor, but so is using multiple substances at the same time. For example, cocaine showed up in 30% of toxicology screens for opioid-related deaths from 2013–2014. Nearly 60% of post-mortem toxicology screens were positive for benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are a type of tranquilizer, including drugs like Valium, Xanax, and Ativan and are typically used to treat anxiety.</p>
                            <p>While cocaine is always illegal, benzodiazepines are legally available but might be used outside a prescription. Although Benzodiazepines were present in in nearly 1,000 toxicology screens, only about half that many people ever had a prescription for one. Fewer than 200 had a benzodiazepine prescription within a month of death. This suggests that the supply of benzodiazepines involved in overdoses includes both prescribed and diverted pills.</p>

                            <h2>Illegal Drugs</h2>
                            <p>When it comes to illegal opioids, Massachusetts is facing a dangerous combination of trends. Some individuals are transitioning from legal to illegal opioid use, perhaps due to dependence and addiction developing beyond prescribed thresholds. At the same time, the availability of illegal drugs strengthens across the region. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) surveyed law enforcement officials about the availability of heroin in 8 regions across the country from 2007 to 2014. Each year, New England led all regions in the percentage of respondents who reported high heroin availability</p>
                            <p>Heroin, perhaps expectedly, is commonly found in toxicology reports for opioid-related deaths. Data from 2013–2014 shows heroin was likely or definitely in the system at the time of death in more than 60% of opioid-related overdose deaths. What might be surprising is the increasingly deadly role Fentanyl is playing in the crisis.</p>
                            <p>While Fentanyl can be available as a legally-prescribed medication, it is most often used illegally. Only about 3% of people who died from an opioid-related overdose and had Fentanyl present in their toxicology screen during the study period had a prescription for Fentanyl at the time of death. However, toxicology data shows Heroin, Fentanyl, or both substances were present in 85% of cases.</p>

                                <p>Fentanyl is an opioid that can be prescribed for pain management. However, it’s also used illegally either on its own or combined with Heroin. According to the DEA, illegally produced Fentanyl can be up to 50 times stronger than Heroin. Illegally sold and produced Fentanyl is increasingly recognized as a problem across the United States, and particularly in Massachusetts. Toxicology data from recent post-mortem cases indicates <span class="fentanyl_">Fentanyl</span> is adding to the state’s deadly epidemic more than <span class="heroin_">Heroin</span>. In 2015, 57% of toxicology samples tested positive for Fentanyl which is more than double the figure recorded in 2013.</p>

                            <p>The fight to curb the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts is also a battle to protect future generations. The percentage of opioid deaths for different age groups shows the young people of Massachusetts are especially at risk. From 2013–2014, opioids accounted for more than a quarter of all fatalities in the <a id="age18to24" onclick="_gaq.push(['b._trackEvent', 'intext', 'clicked', 'demo-age-18-24'])">18–24</a> age group. For individuals from <a id="age25to34" onclick="_gaq.push(['b._trackEvent', 'intext', 'clicked', 'demo-age-25-34'])">25–34</a>, opioids were responsible for more than a third of all deaths, rising to more than 40% for men in this group. In 2015, roughly 2 out of every 3 people who died from opioids were younger than 45.</p>

                            <h2>Race and Ethnicity</h2>
                            <p>In 2000, the rate of opioid-related fatal overdose was 5.8 per 100,000 people in Massachusetts, according to DPH data. That rate has increased steadily since then, with the figure hitting 11.1 per 100,000 in 2012. However, the increase in the last three years has been especially sharp. By 2015, there were 23.4 fatal overdoses for every 100,000 residents.</p>
                            <p>While the death rate within Massachusetts differs for various racial and ethnic groups, people from all backgrounds in the Bay State are caught up in the deadly epidemic. At least three of the state’s largest racial groups had overdose rates above the national average of 9.7 per 100,000 in 2014 — white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic.</p>

                                        <p>Using age-adjusted data is important because different groups have different age distributions, whether those groups are broken out by racial/ethnic, gender, or geographic lines. For example, the Hispanic population in Massachusetts is relatively younger than other racial/ethnic groups in the state. Without taking age distribution into account, the fact that younger people are more likely to die from opioid-related overdoses could result in an over-estimated death rate for the Hispanic community as a whole. We might experience similar mischaracterization when looking at cities and towns that skew older or younger than the rest of the state. In these ways and others, age-adjusting population data helps public health officials get a more accurate picture of the crisis and better target the most problematic areas and populations.</p>

                                        <p>Statisticians use confidence intervals to indicate the level of certainty of a measurement by showing a range of likely results. Analyzing a population is often done by looking at samples that are intended to be representative of the whole group. It is easier to assess whether that representation is accurate when the sample size is larger. For example, it’s easier to trust the results of a survey with thousands of respondents than one with only a dozen respondents. So, adjusted for different sample sizes, confidence intervals show the precision of different results. </p>
                                        <p>When counts are smaller, rates are less precise and confidence intervals are wider. Larger samples have narrower ranges. Note that the confidence intervals on the rates for non-Hispanic blacks are much wider than those around the rates for non-Hispanic whites. This is because fewer non-Hispanic blacks are dying from opioid-related overdoses than non-Hispanic whites, so their sample size is smaller.</p>
                                        <p>When comparing two results, you can only be sure that there is truly a difference when the confidence intervals do not overlap. An example of this is seen in the death rates for the black non-Hispanic and Hispanic populations. While the projections look higher for 2015, since the confidence intervals overlap, we can’t be sure that the numbers are significantly different from 2014 because the results could fall anywhere within either overlapping range. </p>

                                        <p>When doing population analysis, statisticians will often use a rate per sample size (example: rate per 100,000), rather than just a raw count. Densely populated areas are more likely to show many types of behavior, whether good or bad, because there are simply more people. By using raw count, the largest cities would always show up as hot spots and probably draw the most focus and resources. In contrast, a raw count change from 100 to 200 in a city of 1 million (was 0.01%, now 0.02%) might not seem as significant as if that same change happened in a town of 2000 (was 5%, now 10%).</p>
                                        <p>For example, since the non-Hispanic White population is larger in Massachusetts than other similar groups, if we just went by raw count, we couldn’t be sure whether the higher number reflected a larger problem, or just a larger sample. By normalizing all the rates to the same sample size, we can properly compare groups to see that the problem is truly more prevalent among non-Hispanic Whites than among other groups.</p>
                                        <p>Comparing apples to apples by standardizing to a normalized rate helps public health officials get a more accurate picture so they can develop the right strategies to combat the epidemic.</p>

                                <h2>Incarcerated Population</h2>
                                <p>When an inmate is released from prison in Massachusetts, their ability to re-enter society is being threatened by the opioid crisis. The risk of opioid-related death following incarceration is more than 50 times greater than for the general public. What’s more concerning is that the threat is immediate. Fatal overdoses during the first month after release are six times higher than for all other post-incarceration periods.</p>
                                <p>Among inmates who both were released and died between 2013 and 2014, opioid overdose was the cause of death in 40% of the cases. Following the age trend noted above, the risk of death for people aged 18–24 in this group is roughly 10 times higher than for individuals 45 or older. While some portion of inmates receives substance use treatment while incarcerated, it’s unclear how, when, or for how long that treatment takes place.</p>

                            <p>The opioid epidemic won’t be solved overnight, and there’s no easy solution to make this problem disappear. Defeating this crisis requires a dedicated, holistic approach that involves the health care industry, the mind of the public, and the halls of the State House, and public support. </p>
                            <p>However, there are signs of hope and a turning tide. The Chapter 55 report itself marks an unprecedented approach to data analysis that involved the public sector working closely with leading universities in Massachusetts and the private sector. The information, trends, and findings in the report have already provided eye-opening insights to the deadly epidemic. </p>
                            <p>There is still work to be done, and there are still questions that need answers. Powerful legislation can help combat the crisis, and further studies and monitoring of this issue can continue to provide important information about the epidemic.</p>
                            <p>While the crisis in Massachusetts is the focus of these efforts, the Bay State can set the example for how to address this issue from all angles for a nation reeling from a spike in opioid abuse and death.</p>

                    <li id="footnote-2">In both 2014 and 2015, there was 1 death of a Massachusetts resident whose city/town of residence was not known.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-3">Please note that data for 2000-2013 have been updated following a review of cases that did not receive an official cause of death at the time the file was closed. Death data for 2014-2015 are preliminary and subject to updates. Case reviews of deaths are evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis. A large number of death certificates have yet to be assigned final cause-of-death codes. These counts are based on the estimates rather than confirmed cases.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-4">Cases were defined using the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes for mortality. The following codes were selected from the underlying cause of death field to identify poisonings/overdoses: X40-X49, Y10-Y19. All multiple cause of death fields were then used to identify an opioid-related death: T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, and T40.6.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-5">The average annual opioid-related death rate was calculated in 5-year intervals. The death rate displayed is the crude, non age-adjusted rate.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-6">In 1999, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) replaced the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for coding all mortality data. Because there were changes made in the codes that are assigned to causes of death, changes to the rules used to determine the underlying cause of death, and changes in the codes that comprise the leading cause of death categories, direct comparisons of causes of death between 1999 and previous years cannot be made.</li>
