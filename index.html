                                    <h4>What are opioids?</h4>
                                    <p>The term Opioid means “opiate-like”. It generally refers to a family of substances that include natural opiates (like Morphine and Codeine), as well as synthetic and semi-synthetic opioids like Heroin, Oxycodone, and Fentanyl.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h4>What do opioids do?</h4>
                                    <p>The most common medical use of opioids is in the treatment of pain across a broad spectrum, from acute post-surgical pain, to chronic pain in cancer patients, to end of life care. Opioids can also be misused, like taking a higher dosage of a painkiller than what a doctor prescribed. Other types of misuse can be unlawful, including taking heroin — which is illegal in all instances — or taking Oxycodone that has been legally prescribed to another person. This latter behavior, transferring drugs prescribed for one person to be used by someone else, is known as “diversion”.</p>

                                    <h4>What are the side-effects of using opioids?</h4>
                                    <p>Short-term side-effects include drowsiness, depressed breathing, and euphoria. Long-term usage can trigger the body to develop tolerance, dependence, and addiction.</p>
                                    <ul class="neg-space-col">
                                        <li><strong>Tolerance</strong> is the body’s natural response to the regular presence of a substance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Dependence</strong> occurs when the body becomes so accustomed to the presence of a substance that its sudden absence causes withdrawal. For an opioid user, that could also mean that a prescription to address localized pain (a shoulder, a knee, a back) could cause pain all over the body if the prescription ends without tapering off.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Addiction</strong> is a complex brain-body disease, where brain and body responses have changed to negatively and drastically affect behavior. This often includes an irresistible compulsion for short-term relief even in the face of both immediate and long-term risk.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Each side-effect is independent of the others, meaning that any, all, or none may occur in any individual.</p>

In total, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/stop-addiction/dph-legislative-report-chapter-55-opioid-overdose-study-9-15-2016.pdf#page=95">29 groups</a> from government, higher education, and the private sector provided information and expertise.

Before this legislation was passed, such a comprehensive look at the opioid epidemic in the Commonwealth would not have been possible.</p>
                            <p>In addition to providing significant insights into the opioid crisis by answering <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/stop-addiction/dph-legislative-report-chapter-55-opioid-overdose-study-9-15-2016.pdf#page=41">seven key questions</a>, this project demonstrates how private and public organizations can collaborate to answer complex public-health questions. This model of cooperative data analysis has the potential to become the standard in Massachusetts and across the United States. The Chapter 55 project represents a process that should be continued, adapted, and refined as new public health challenges and new collaborators step forward.</p>
                            <p>Below are examples of opioid-use trends that were uncovered by Chapter 55 analysis. Real, actionable steps to curb the epidemic can be taken as a direct result of this innovative data effort.</p>

			    <p>Similar to diabetes or cancer, <a class="controls controls-video js-play-video" data-target="#video3"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-facetime-video" aria-hidden="true"></span> addiction is a complex disease  <span class="sr-only"> play video</span></a> impacted by certain risk factors like behavior and family history. Compulsive substance abuse, cravings, and continued use despite known harmful consequences are hallmarks of the condition. This disease is also more widespread than some may realize — according to a <a href='http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-FRR1-2014/NSDUH-FRR1-2014.pdf#page=6' target="_blank">SAMHSA study</a>, nearly 1 in 12 Americans over the age of 12 have a substance abuse disorder.</p>

                            <p>Economically, addiction is more costly than other brain conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke. In fact, <a href='https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics' target="_blank">data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a> shows costs related to substance abuse top more than $700 billion annually in the United States.</p>
                            <p>However, economic impacts are hardly the most negative aspects of addiction and, more specifically, the opioid epidemic. Addiction to opioids can put people at greater risk for infectious diseases like HIV or hepatitis, deteriorating conditions like cirrhosis or cognitive decline, family disruption like domestic violence or child abuse, job loss, exposure to criminal behavior, overdose, and death.</p>

            			    <p>Data from the DPH Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) shows an increasing need for opioid-related treatment in Massachusetts. In 2000, <a id="toggleOpioidsY2000" onclick="opioidsY2000()" class="btn-bsas" data-val="massachusetts">about one third</a> of admissions to substance abuse treatment centers and programs were opioid related<a href="#footnote-2" class="page-scroll" aria-describedby="footnote-label"><span class="sr-only">see footnote</span><sup>2</sup></a>. By 2015, that figure had increased to <a id="toggleOpioidsY2015" onclick="opioidsY2015()" class="btn-bsas" data-val="massachusetts">more than half</a>, overtaking alcohol as the most prevalent substance recorded by BSAS at treatment intake. The Health Policy Commission (HPC) recorded similar figures for emergency room visits and hospitalizations during that time.</p>
                            <p>Along with the rise in demand for opioid-use treatment, nationally and in Massachusetts, there has been an increase in opioid overdoses, both fatal and nonfatal.</p>

                            <p>Opioids are incredibly powerful drugs that have transformed the way the health care world treats and manages pain. However, because they are so potent, they can be dangerous if misused. To understand the opioid epidemic, it’s important to realize how both legal prescription medications and illegal substances impact the crisis in Massachusetts. To investigate the scope of the problem, we considered the entire population of all adults<a href="#footnote-1" class="page-scroll" onclick="BoldText(document.getElementById(&quot;footnote-1&quot;));"><sup>10</sup></a> as potential opioid users.</p>

                            <p>The number of opioids prescribed to residents of Massachusetts has increased roughly 7% annually since 2000. Between 2011 and 2014, 2 in 5 adults in the study had legal prescriptions for opioids, averaging more than 6 opioid prescriptions each. If spread out across the whole group, that’s roughly 2.5 opioid prescriptions per adult. During that period, about 8.8 million opioid prescriptions were filled in total.</p>

                            <p>Even when people use opioids for legitimate medical reasons, they can become dependent on or addicted to the drug. When this happens, the body’s craving for an opioid continues even if a prescription runs out. In these cases, many people continue to use opioids illegally. More than <a class="controls controls-svg" data-select="2/3">two thirds</a> of people who died from an opioid overdose had a legal opioid prescription at some point. Of those who died, however, only about <a class="controls controls-svg" data-select="1/12">1 in 12</a> had a prescription in the month before their death. </p>
                            <p>It should be noted that opioid-related deaths began increasing sharply in 2012, no similar increase in opioid prescriptions was recorded. This suggests that no single substance or health care practice is solely responsible for the current opioid crisis. Rather, it’s a complex issue with a number of contributing factors.</p>

                            <h2>Multiple Prescribers</h2>
                            <p>One risk factor for fatal overdose that was identified was the number of opioid prescribers for an individual. There are legitimate reasons why someone might have multiple prescribers — primary care plus specialists or multi-provider practices — but there is an elevated risk for this group. The fatal overdose rate for individuals with three or more prescribers is 7 times higher than the rate for other people.</p>
                            <h2>Multiple Substances</h2>
                            <p>Not only is having multiple prescribers a risk factor, but so is using multiple substances at the same time. For example, cocaine showed up in 30% of toxicology screens for opioid-related deaths from 2013–2014. Nearly 60% of post-mortem toxicology screens were positive for benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are a type of tranquilizer, including drugs like Valium, Xanax, and Ativan and are typically used to treat anxiety.</p>
                            <p>While cocaine is always illegal, benzodiazepines are legally available but might be used outside a prescription. Although Benzodiazepines were present in in nearly 1,000 toxicology screens, only about half that many people ever had a prescription for one. Fewer than 200 had a benzodiazepine prescription within a month of death. This suggests that the supply of benzodiazepines involved in overdoses includes both prescribed and diverted pills.</p>

                            <h2>Illegal Drugs</h2>
                            <p>When it comes to illegal opioids, Massachusetts is facing a dangerous combination of trends. Some individuals are transitioning from legal to illegal opioid use, perhaps due to dependence and addiction developing beyond prescribed thresholds. At the same time, the availability of illegal drugs strengthens across the region. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) surveyed law enforcement officials about the availability of heroin in 8 regions across the country from 2007 to 2014. Each year, New England led all regions in the percentage of respondents who reported high heroin availability</p>
                            <p>Heroin, perhaps expectedly, is commonly found in toxicology reports for opioid-related deaths. Data from 2013–2014 shows heroin was likely or definitely in the system at the time of death in more than 60% of opioid-related overdose deaths. What might be surprising is the increasingly deadly role Fentanyl is playing in the crisis.</p>
                            <p>While Fentanyl can be available as a legally-prescribed medication, it is most often used illegally. Only about 3% of people who died from an opioid-related overdose and had Fentanyl present in their toxicology screen during the study period had a prescription for Fentanyl at the time of death. However, toxicology data shows Heroin, Fentanyl, or both substances were present in 85% of cases.</p>

                                <hr>
                                <p>Fentanyl is an opioid that can be prescribed for pain management. However, it’s also used illegally either on its own or combined with heroin. According to the DEA, illegally produced Fentanyl can be up to 50 times stronger than heroin. Illegally sold and produced Fentanyl is increasingly recognized as a problem across the United States, and particularly in Massachusetts. Toxicology data from recent post-mortem cases indicates <span class="fentanyl_">Fentanyl</span> is adding to the state’s deadly epidemic more than <span class="heroin_">Heroin</span>. In 2015, 57% of toxicology samples tested positive for Fentanyl which is more than double the figure recorded in 2013.</p>

                            <p>Opioid addiction doesn’t discriminate. The crisis in Massachusetts impacts people from all backgrounds.

That rate has increased steadily since then, with the figure hitting 11.1 per 100,000 in 2012. However, the increase in the last three years has been especially sharp. By 2015, there were 23.4 fatal overdoses for every 100,000 residents.</p>
                            <p>While the death rate within Massachusetts differs for various racial and ethnic groups, people from all backgrounds in the Bay State are caught up in the deadly epidemic. At least three of the state’s largest racial groups had overdose rates above the national average of 9.7 per 100,000 in 2014 — white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic.</p>

                            <p>When an inmate is released from prison in Massachusetts, their ability to re-enter society is being threatened by the opioid crisis. The risk of opioid-related death following incarceration is more than 50 times greater than for the general public. What’s more concerning is that the threat is immediate. Fatal overdoses during the first month after release are six times higher than for all other post-incarceration periods.</p>
                            <p>Among inmates who both were released and died between 2013 and 2014, opioid overdose was the cause of death in 40% of the cases. Following the age trend noted above, the risk of death for people aged 18–24 in this group is roughly 10 times higher than for individuals 45 or older. While some portion of inmates receives substance use treatment while incarcerated, it’s unclear how, when, or for how long that treatment takes place.</p>

                            <p>However, there are signs of hope and a turning tide. The Chapter 55 report itself marks an unprecedented approach to data analysis that involved the public sector working closely with leading universities in Massachusetts and the private sector. The information, trends, and findings in the report have already provided eye-opening insights to the deadly epidemic. </p>
                            <p>There is still work to be done, and there are still questions that need answers. Powerful legislation can help combat the crisis, and further studies and monitoring of this issue can continue to provide important information about the epidemic.</p>
