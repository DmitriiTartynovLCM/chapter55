00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.200
I was an addict for 25 years.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.030
In and out of programs,
in and out of jail.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.230
Since I was a kid,
that's what I knew,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.700
and I didn't know that
there was a better positive way

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.660
that I could live my life.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.560
When I was out running around
on the streets,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.800
people would look at you
a different way.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.560
If you're walking on one side
of the sidewalk,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.760
they'll cross to the other side.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.230
I was like,
"Why am I going to go get clean?

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.630
"Why am I going to go
through a program?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.960
"Why am I gonna do this

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.330
when I'm always going to be
the same person?"

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.230
It's kind of hard for you
to try to step up to the plate

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.900
and, you know, change your life.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.060
There is a problem
with addiction, right?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.460
But if you turn
your back on them, right,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.260
the problem
is still gonna be there.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.760
But I think as a community,
if we all get together, right,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.400
we can help each other one out.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800
Now that I'm
in long-term recovery,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.360
it's been a blessing to me.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.160
You know,
I've got my family back,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.560
I've got my son back,
my aunt, my sister.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
You know,
helping my community out,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.560
it's meant the world to me

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.200
because I grew up in a community
that I took so much from,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.700
you know, and now I work
in my community

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.700
where I was born and raised at
and helping my people out.
