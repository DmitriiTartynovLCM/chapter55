00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.400
The stigma of my daughter's addiction was, you know,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.000
I tried to keep it hidden from the outside world.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
You know, I didn't want people coming over to the house.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.630
I've been guilty of calling her a junkie myself.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.360
And, you know, you get told that so many times,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.130
who wants to go to recovery?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.560
You're believing it.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.730
"I'm a junkie.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
I'm not worth the paper to sign to get into recovery."

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.960
That's how they feel,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.700
and that's not going to help anybody get better.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.860
They've got to be encouraged.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.960
From my personal experience, everybody that I've known

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.060
or that I knew that has an opioid addiction

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.260
are brilliant people with so much to offer the world.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860
And they get beat down and beat down

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.400
and stop believing that they're not worth it.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.230
I've got the, you know,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.030
"She could have been a better mother," from strangers, really.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.560
Oh, it hurt like hell.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.230
It hurt like hell, you know?

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.060
And you always want better than you had as a child

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.760
and, you know, as a mom, you want to see her succeed.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.500
You want to see them succeed.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.060
And, you know, that wasn't me.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.060
I was waiting for that phone call every night.
