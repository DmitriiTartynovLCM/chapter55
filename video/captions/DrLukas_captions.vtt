So we have these brain chemicals, there's
a whole host of them. One of them

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.050 align:middle line:90%
that's of particular importance to us is
dopamine. Now dopamine is something that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.980 align:middle line:90%
allows us just feel good. You feel
pleasure if you score the winning goal

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:90%
in your high school team, you feel
pleasure if you nail that exam or if you

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.779 align:middle line:90%
played a beautiful piece flawlessly
and you didn't make a single mistake and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:84%
you feel really good, and somebody or your boss said "way to go, good job". That's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:90%
natural pleasure. If you were to take
morphine or heroin or some of the other

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:90%
opiates they bind to an endogenous
opiate receptor in the brain, and those

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:90%
receptors are very close to where the
dopamine receptors are. And so what they

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:90%
do is they make more dopamine release.
That euphoria is much greater than

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:90%
the normal feeling of just feeling
good.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever been on a seesaw with
a friend and you have to adjust your

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.829 align:middle line:90%
side you so that you guys are just
perfectly balanced right? And then what

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:90%
do you do as a nine-year-old? You kinda
scoot back a little bit, then you to jump

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.460 align:middle line:90%
off real quick, you know, and you
laugh and you see your friend go down to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
the ground. That's actually how the brain works, and so we've got this really nice

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:90%
balancing act going on and now you take
heroin and you put heroin on it, well

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:84%
that pushes it down like this.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Well the brain says wait a minute that's
not the normal. The brain tries to compensate

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:84%
for that.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh well we have to use more drug because
now we're not feeling the effects.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the tolerance. The problem with that
is what happens when you stop? Now you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:90%
have anxiety, irritability, a very bad
mood. They start getting very anxious and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:90%
upset, and in fact there are a lot of
physiological changes that occur as well.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:90%
They get fairly profound diarrhea, they
start to salivate, their eyes water, they

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.729 align:middle line:90%
get photosensitive. And if they take heroin
during that time,

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.439 align:middle line:90%
guess what heroin does? It removes that bad
feeling, and that's called negative

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:90%
reinforcement, and nothing is more
powerful than taking away pain.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
