Eighty percent of young people at some point will experiment with drugs or

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.230
alcohol. So I would imagine many of us have made that choice so to speak of

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
putting ourselves at risk of the exposure of drugs or alcohol. And so

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.970
you could say that everyone who's ever made a choice to try a drug or to try

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.980
alcohol, you know, should be blamed for that, but that is most of society.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.180
The brain structure and function literally changes with ongoing drug or alcohol use,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.420
and it's the exact same thing you see with a heart after a heart attack for

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.750
example, where literally the function of the heart changes once the disease is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.610
developed. This whole area now where there's no color has been diseased.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.420
So the World Health Organization looked at 18 stigmatized conditions across the globe

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
including being a prisoner, having hiv/aids, and drug addiction was more

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.440
stigmatized and all of those things. But we know that stigma is one of the main

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.620
reasons that people don't access treatment, and also why people wait a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030
long time before they come into care. But as we understand and hopefully spread

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.180
the message that this is a chronic disease is that there's treatment out

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
there, treatment works, and the important thing is coming into care and coming in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.600
as early as possible.
