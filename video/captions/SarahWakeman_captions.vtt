Eighty percent of young people at some
point will experiment with drugs or

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.230 align:middle line:90%
alcohol. So I would imagine many of us
have made that choice so to speak of

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580 align:middle line:90%
putting ourselves at risk of the
exposure of drugs or alcohol. And so

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:90%
you could say that everyone who's ever
made a choice to try a drug or to try

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:90%
alcohol, you know, should be blamed for
that, but that is most of society.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:90%
The brain structure and function literally
changes with ongoing drug or alcohol use,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and it's the exact same thing you see
with a heart after a heart attack for

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:90%
example, where literally the function of
the heart changes once the disease is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:90%
developed. This whole area now where
there's no color has been diseased.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:90%
So the World Health Organization looked at 18
stigmatized conditions across the globe

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:90%
including being a prisoner, having
hiv/aids, and drug addiction was more

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:90%
stigmatized and all of those things. But
we know that stigma is one of the main

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:90%
reasons that people don't access
treatment, and also why people wait a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
long time before they come into care. But
as we understand and hopefully spread

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:90%
the message that this is a chronic
disease is that there's treatment out

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199 align:middle line:90%
there, treatment works, and the important
thing is coming into care and coming in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
as early as possible.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle line:84%

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:84%
