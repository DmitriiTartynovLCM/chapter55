00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.680
4.4 million Schedule II and III

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.759
prescriptions, worth over 240 million

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.970
pills. I should remind everybody that we

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.650
only have six and a half million people

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.769
in the Commonwealth of Mass. In the same year

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.900
over 1,200 people died of opioid

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.800
overdoses. Simply put the status quo is

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.900
unacceptable and it needs to be

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.910
disrupted.
